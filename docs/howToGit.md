# How To Git
For more instructions, maybe it's time to learn git. The general workflow is to start a stage in the directory(s) that you want to affect, then start commiting changes. Generally `Commit and Push` is fine unless multiple people have edited the repository you're pulling from in which case you might want their changes.

All of this can be done from the **Source Control** tab in VSC.
