It also has a pretty sleek and friendly UI for source control.</li> <li>Git. You can leave everything on default settings if you're installing it for the first time. No Git knowledge is required since we'll be doing our source control inside of VSC.</li> <li>Python - I'm using version 3.13 but you can use 3.14 if you wish.</li> </ol> <p>On VSC, you'll also need the follow extensions and any prerequisites they install:</p> <ol> <li>Python</li> <li>Python Environments</li> </ol>"},{"location":"howToContribute/#creating-the-workspace","title":"Creating the workspace","text":"<p>A workspace is VSC's version of a file explorer.

In another folder, we'll also have our local version of the repository. The local repository is how we'll be remotely working on any changes that will eventually be pushed to the repository hosted on GitHub.

Note that because we are using a virtual environment, you'll have to run the command every time you want to preview the change.</li> <li>We care about making the contribution process easy for ourselves.
